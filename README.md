# subproblem-polynomial

Whenever search is used with subproblems to solve kinematics problems, an alternative method can be used that guarantees finding all solutions. Each subproblem can be written as a multivariate polynomial in $x_i = \tan(q_i/2)$. The error function can also be written as a similar polynomial. Then, the resultant of this system of polynomials can be found to eliminate all but one variable. The zeros of this polynomial can be easily obtained, and these zeros correspond to the zeros of the error function. Subproblems can then be used to find the remaining joint angles.
